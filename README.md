## Assumptions

There are a few assumptions I've made while coding this. These are those assumptions:
- Files run against this program only include completed trainings. They do not, for example, include trainings that have been assigned but not yet completed. In order words, 'timestamp' is never null.
- 'Within one month' means 'within 30 days'.

## Running this Program
1. 'npm install' from project root
2. 'npm run dev'
3. open localhost:3000
